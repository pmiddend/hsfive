# hsfive â€” HDF5 in pure Haskell

## Goal

The goal of this project is to implement at least a read-only version of an HDF5 library, ideally compatible with the filter plugins, so you can read, for example, Dectris detector data.

## Current state

This is very much a piece of nothing right now, don't take the project too seriously. Once it's got Haddocks and is on hackage, take notice of this.
